## Project Summary
We have developed an interactive museum featuring 3D images of real exoplanets. Our approach addresses the challenge of providing educational accessibility to minority groups, including indigenous adolescents and children, as well as the general public. This project is of vital importance, as many people are unaware of exoplanets and astronomy. Our goal is to deliver knowledge in a didactic way to the population of Riobamba, Ecuador, and its surrounding communities. We aim to seek support from public institutions, such as the Ministry of Tourism or the Provincial Decentralized Autonomous Government, to ensure broad reach and impact.

## Project Details

This project offers a virtual tour in an interactive planetarium, simulated as a hypothetical spacecraft, where two exoplanet systems can be explored: Trappist-1 and Kepler-90. In addition, these systems can be viewed in rotation from the outside, providing the user with a more recreational experience. On the other hand, there is a room dedicated to exoplanet detection methods that, through the use of computers, mobile phones and the VR experience, will allow different communities to learn more about these planetary systems, offering innovative learning through technology that we can take to the different areas where they reside.

In Twinmotion it is possible to make 3D renderings, panoramic views, 360° tours, augmented reality experiences and export to websites for viewing on mobile devices, all this by creating a virtual environment in the application. To move around in this environment, we use the common keys of video games, generating a familiar atmosphere for our users.

We seek support from public institutions, such as the Ministry of Tourism or the Provincial Decentralized Autonomous Government, to ensure a broad reach and impact. We have designed images of real exoplanets using Blender to offer an immersive 3D educational experience, which will be projected on a large scale.

Our goal is to educate a large number of people and leave a lasting impact on the way astronomy is taught. We want education to be exciting and spark interest in exoplanet astronomy. In the short term, we have delimited a rural parish in Riobamba, the community of Cacha, a descendant of the Puruháes, taking into account the need that we have identified from our experience. It is a place with a rich culture, but one that has been forgotten by those who could bring more knowledge. In Cacha we will use resources such as projectors, homemade holograms and virtual reality technology, which will be provided by the team.

In the medium term, we intend to carry out immersive screenings in Riobamba, using facilities such as the House Museum, the León Theater, and bring portable experiences to educational units. And our last long-term goal is to hold talks with experts on exoplanets and establish a planetarium in Riobamba, a project that will promote both education and tourism where we will need the appropriate infrastructure to project large-scale 3D images, either on building facades or even inside a planetarium.

Our long-term goal is to organize talks with exoplanet experts and establish a planetarium in Riobamba. This project will not only boost education, but also tourism, and we will need the right infrastructure to project large-scale 3D images, whether on the facades of buildings or inside a planetarium.

We use tools like Blender and Twinmotion to create immersive experiences, and we also plan to incorporate holograms to enhance the experience. In addition, we intend to develop products, such as exoplanet-themed lamps, that are both visually appealing and educational. To achieve this, we will use 3D printing to create accurate models of the different types of exoplanets. Additional tools include NASA platforms and Photoshop for textures, plus Gamma for website creation.
