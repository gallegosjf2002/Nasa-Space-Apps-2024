## Project Summary
We have developed an interactive museum featuring 3D images of real exoplanets. Our approach addresses the challenge of providing educational accessibility to minority groups, including indigenous adolescents and children, as well as the general public. This project is of vital importance, as many people are unaware of exoplanets and astronomy. Our goal is to deliver knowledge in a didactic way to the population of Riobamba, Ecuador, and its surrounding communities. We aim to seek support from public institutions, such as the Ministry of Tourism or the Provincial Decentralized Autonomous Government, to ensure broad reach and impact.

## Project Details

This project offers a virtual tour in an interactive planetarium, simulated as a hypothetical spacecraft, where two exoplanet systems can be explored: Trappist-1 and Kepler-90. In addition, these systems can be viewed in rotation from the outside, providing the user with a more recreational experience. On the other hand, there is a room dedicated to exoplanet detection methods that, through the use of computers, mobile phones and the VR experience, will allow different communities to learn more about these planetary systems, offering innovative learning through technology that we can take to the different areas where they reside.
