# Hawa Pachata (outside world)
## Project Summary
We have developed an interactive museum featuring 3D images of real exoplanets. Our approach addresses the challenge of providing educational accessibility to minority groups, including indigenous adolescents and children, as well as the general public. This project is of vital importance, as many people are unaware of exoplanets and astronomy. Our goal is to deliver knowledge in a didactic way to the population of Riobamba, Ecuador, and its surrounding communities. We aim to seek support from public institutions, such as the Ministry of Tourism or the Provincial Decentralized Autonomous Government, to ensure broad reach and impact.
